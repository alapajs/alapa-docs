# **Alapa Directory Structure**

When you generate a new Alapa project using the command `npx create-alapa-app [ProjectName]`, you’ll get a well-organized and modular directory structure designed to make development intuitive, scalable, and maintainable. Below is a detailed breakdown of the key directories and files in an Alapa starter project:

### **Root Directory (`/`)**

The root directory contains configuration files, environment settings, and project metadata. Here’s what you’ll find:

- **`.env`**: Stores environment variables such as API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive or environment-specific settings.
- **`Dockerfile`**: Defines the Docker image configuration for containerizing the application.
- **`alapa-env.d.ts`**: A TypeScript declaration file for environment variables or custom types.
- **`eslint.config.mjs`**: Configuration file for ESLint, ensuring code quality and consistency.
- **`package.json`** and **`package-lock.json`**: Define project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
- **`postcss.config.js`**: Configuration for PostCSS, used for processing CSS with plugins like Tailwind CSS.
- **`readme.md`**: Documentation for the project, including setup instructions, usage, and other relevant information.
- **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file, defining compiler options and project settings.

---

### **Development Tools (`/dev`)**

This directory contains scripts and tools for development purposes:

- **`index.js`**: The entry point for development-specific scripts or tools.
- **`refresh.js`**: A script to refresh browsers on changes.

---

### **Documentation (`/docs`)**

Alapa’s documentation is generated and maintained here:

- **`generate.ts`**: A script for generating API documentation.
- **`schemas/`**: Contains schema definitions (e.g., `user.yaml`) for reference in your API documentation.

---

### **Database Migrations (`/migration-runner`)**

This directory handles database migrations, ensuring smooth schema updates:

- **`data-source.ts`**: Configuration for database migrations, likely using an ORM like TypeORM.
- **`generate.ts`**: A script to generate new database migrations.
- **`run.ts`**: A script to execute database migrations.

---

### **Public (`/public`)**

This directory contains assets that are compiled using Webpack to generate static files:

- **`src/`**: Contains source files for public assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, TypeScript).
- **`styles/`**: Stores stylesheets, including preprocessed SCSS files.
- **`application.scss`**: The main SCSS file for global styles.

---

### **Source Code (`/src`)**

The core of the Alapa application, organized into modules for better maintainability:

- **`index.ts`**: The main entry point of the application. This file initializes and starts the Alapa application, tying together all the modules and configurations.
- **`api/`**: Contains API-related logic.
  - **`routes.ts`**: Defines API routes.
  - **`index.ts`**: Entry point for the API module.
- **`apps/`**: Houses application-specific logic or sub-applications.
  - **`routes.ts`**: Defines routes for the application.
  - **`index.ts`**: Entry point for the application module.
- **`config/`**: Houses configuration files for various aspects of the application. Files like api.ts, database.ts, auth.ts, etc., provide modular configuration for APIs, databases, authentication, and more.
- **`models/`**: Contains data models, such as `user.ts`, defining the structure and behavior of database entities.
- **`shared/`**: Stores shared utilities, helpers, or common functionality used across the application.

---

### **Static Files (`/static`)**

Static files like images, JavaScript, and CSS are organized here:

- **`images/`**: Stores static image assets.
- **`js/`**: Contains JavaScript files, such as `app.js`, for client-side functionality.
- **`css/`**: Houses CSS files, including `app.css` and `styles.css`, for styling the application.

---

### **Testing (`/test`)**

This directory is reserved for test files (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) to ensure the application functions as expected. (Note: This directory is currently empty but is typically used for testing purposes.)

---

### **Views (`/views`)**

The `views` directory is used for server-side rendering or templating:

- **`components/`**: Stores reusable UI components.
- **`error/`**: Contains error pages (e.g., 404, 500).
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file for the application’s front end.

---

### **Other Files and Directories**

- **`node_modules/`**: Contains installed dependencies managed by npm or Yarn.

---

### **Why This Structure?**

Alapa’s directory structure is designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Modularity**: Separating concerns (e.g., `api/`, `apps/`, `models/`) makes the codebase easier to maintain and scale.
2. **Flexibility**: The `config/` directory allows developers to add custom configurations as needed, ensuring the structure adapts to the project’s requirements.
3. **Static Assets**: The `static/` and `public/` directories ensure that static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images are organized and accessible.
4. **Documentation and Tooling**: The `docs/` and `dev/` directories highlight a focus on documentation and development tooling.
5. **TypeScript Support**: The presence of TypeScript files (`*.ts`) and `tsconfig.json` ensures strong typing and modern JavaScript practices.

---

### **Getting Started**

To explore Alapa’s directory structure in action, generate a new project using the command:

```bash
npx create-alapa-app [ProjectName]
```

This will create a starter project with the above structure, ready for you to customize and build upon. Each directory is designed to be self-explanatory, making it easy for developers to understand and contribute to the project.

This structure reflects Alapa’s commitment to simplicity, flexibility, and developer productivity. Whether you’re building a small project or a large-scale application, Alapa’s organized approach ensures a smooth development experience.
