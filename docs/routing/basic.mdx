# **Basic Routing**

Alapa provides a straightforward and flexible routing system for handling HTTP requests. Its routing design is similar to Express, allowing developers to define routes for various HTTP methods easily.

---

## **Defining Routes**

Routes are defined using the `Router` class, which maps specific HTTP methods and URLs to handler functions. Below is an example of a basic route definition:

<CodeScreen title="src/app/index.ts">

```ts
import { Router, Request, Response } from "alapa";

const indexRoute = new Router();

// GET Route
indexRoute.get("/", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send("Welcome to my site!");
});

export default indexRoute;
```

</CodeScreen>
After Defining index Route you can now connect to application routes as show bellow

<CodeScreen title="src/app/routes.ts">
```ts
import { Router } from 'alapa'
import indexRoute from './index'

const routes = new Router()

routes.use(indexRoute)

export default routes
```
</CodeScreen>

<BrowserWindow title="/">Welcome to my site!</BrowserWindow>

## **Supported HTTP Methods**

Alapa supports all common HTTP methods, such as:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `OPTIONS`
- `ALL`

Each method is mapped using a corresponding function (`router.get`, `router.post`, etc.).

### Example:

<CodeScreen title="">

```ts
import { Router, Request, Response } from "alapa";
const router = new Router();

// POST Route
router.post("/submit", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { name, email } = req.body;
  res.send(`Data received: Name: ${name}, Email: ${email}`);
});

// PUT Route
router.put("/update", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { id, data } = req.body;
  res.send(`Updating record ${id} with data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
});

// All Route
router.all("/login", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { user, password } = req.body;
  res.send(`The method is ${req.method}`);
});

// DELETE Route
router.delete("/remove/:id", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  res.send(`Record ${id} has been deleted.`);
});
```

</CodeScreen>

---

## **Route Parameters**

Dynamic segments can be added to routes using the `:` syntax. Parameters are accessible via `req.params`.

### Example:

<CodeScreen title="src/app/users/router.ts">

```ts
import { Router, Request, Response } from "alapa";
const userRoutes = new Router();

userRoutes.get("/users/:id", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  res.send(`Fetching details for user with ID: ${id}`);
});
export default userRoutes;
```

</CodeScreen>

---

<BrowserWindow title="users/1">
  Fetching details for user with ID: 1
</BrowserWindow>

## **Query Strings**

You can handle query strings in routes using `req.query`.

### Example:

<CodeScreen title="src/app/search.ts">
```ts
router.get("/search", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { keyword, page } = req.query;
  res.send(`Search results for '${keyword}' on page ${page}`);
});
```
</CodeScreen>

<BrowserWindow title="search?keyword=foo&page=2">
  Search results for `foo` on page `2`
</BrowserWindow>

## `router.all` Route

The `all` method is a special route handler that matches **all HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for a specific route. This is useful when you want to handle multiple types of requests on the same route but with different behavior depending on the HTTP method being used.

### **How the `all` Method Works:**

- The `router.all("/login", ...)` route will match any HTTP method that targets the `/login` path.
- Inside the route handler, `req.method` contains the HTTP method used for that specific request (such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.).
- This allows you to write a single route handler for multiple methods and handle them dynamically based on the value of `req.method`.

### **Example Breakdown:**

<CodeScreen title="src/app/account/login.html">

```ts
router.all("/login", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { user, password } = req.body;
  res.send(`The method is ${req.method}`);
});
```

</CodeScreen>

- **Request Handling:** This route handler will fire for any HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that matches `/login`.
- **Dynamic Response Based on Method:** The `req.method` value is dynamically injected based on the method that was used to make the request. For example:
  - If the request is a `GET`, `req.method` will be `"GET"`.
  - If the request is a `POST`, `req.method` will be `"POST"`.
- The response will simply echo the HTTP method being used in the request.

### **Use Case of `req.method`:**

- **POST Request:** If you send a `POST` request to `/login`, the handler will process the login form (using `req.body` to get the user and password) and return a message like: `The method is POST`.
- **GET Request:** If you send a `GET` request to `/login`, it will still match the route, but now `req.method` will return `"GET"`, and you can decide to return a different message or handle it in a different way.

### **Example with Different Behavior:**

<CodeScreen title="src/app/account/login.html">

```ts
router.all("/login", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    const { user, password } = req.body;
    res.send(`Login submitted with user: ${user}`);
  } else if (req.method === "GET") {
    res.render("account/login");
  } else {
    res.send(`Unsupported method: ${req.method}`);
  }
});
```

</CodeScreen>

- If the method is `POST`, it will process the login details.
- If the method is `GET`, it will render `views/account/login.html` template.
- For any other HTTP method (like PUT, DELETE), it will return a message stating the method is unsupported.

### **Why Use `all` Route?**

The `all` route is useful when you want to capture all possible HTTP methods for a specific URL and handle them accordingly. However, in many cases, it might be more readable and maintainable to use method-specific routes (e.g., `router.get()`, `router.post()`, etc.) when you know you only need to handle one HTTP method at a time.

The `all` method is more suitable for situations where the behavior needs to vary dynamically based on the method being used.

---

## **Default Route (404 Handling)**

To handle undefined routes, you can define a fallback route:

<CodeScreen title="src/app/routes.ts">
```ts
appRouter.all("*", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(404).send("Page not found");
});
```
</CodeScreen>

---

## **Grouping Routes**

Organize your routes by grouping them using separate files or route prefixes.

### Example:

<CodeScreen title="src/app/routes.ts">

```ts
const userRouter = new Router();
userRouter.get("/profile", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send("User profile");
});

const appRouter = new Router();
appRouter.use("/users", userRouter); // This handles routes prefixed with "/users"

export default appRouter;
```

</CodeScreen>
Now, all routes under `userRouter` will be prefixed with `/users`.

<BrowserWindow title="users/profile">

User profile

</BrowserWindow>

## **Summary**

Alapa routing is highly intuitive, enabling developers to handle routes, parameters, query strings, and even custom route grouping with ease.
